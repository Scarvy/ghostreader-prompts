I just read a document entitled {{ document.title }} and made the following highlights:

{% for highlight in highlights %}
   {{ highlight.content }}
{% endfor %}

Based on my highlights above, make a TL;DR version of the document using as few words as possible. Format it as a list with dashes. The title of the list should be "TL;DR Based On Highlights:".
