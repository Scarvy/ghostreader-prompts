I just read a document entitled {{ document.title }} and made the following highlights:

{% for highlight in highlights %}
   {{ highlight.content }}
{% endfor %}

Based on my highlights above, provide a very detailed and complete summary of the document as a list of key takeaways. Format the list with dashes. The title of the list should be "Key Takeaways Based On Highlights:".
