Make a TL;DR version of the document below entitled "{{ document.title }}" using as few words as possible. Format it as a list with dashes. The title of the list should be "TL;DR:":

"""
{% if (document.content | count_tokens) > 1000 %}
   {{ document.content | central_sentences | join('\n\n') }}
{% else %}
   {{ document.content }}
{% endif %}
"""
