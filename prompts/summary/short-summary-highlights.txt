I just read a document entitled {{ document.title }} and made the following highlights:

{% for highlight in highlights %}
   {{ highlight.content }}
{% endfor %}

Based on my highlights above, provide a short summary of the document. The title of the summary should be "Short Summary Based On Highlights:".
