I just read a document entitled {{ document.title }} and made the following highlights:

{% for highlight in highlights %}
   {{ highlight.content }}
{% endfor %}

Provide a very detailed and complete list of keywords that are implied in the highlights above. Format the list with dashes. The order of the keywords should mirror the structure of the document. Prevent duplication of keywords. The title of the list should be "Keywords Based On Highlights:".
