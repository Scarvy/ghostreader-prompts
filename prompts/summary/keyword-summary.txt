Please provide a concise one sentence summary and then list the key takeaways in an unordered list format using dashes. Write a thorough and comprehensive summary of the key takeaways of the given text, including important details, facts, points, ideas, and implications. Finally generate a few keywords associated with the article.

Format the output as YAML code like this:

Summary:
  - Your concise summary here
Key Takeaways:
  - First key takeaway
  - Second key takeaway
  - Third key takeaway
  ...
Keywords:
  - "[[Keyword 1]]"
  - "[[Keyword 2]]"
  - "[[Keyword 3]]"
  ...

Format the keywords in Title Case and enclose each keyword in quotes and double square brackets like this "[[Keyword]]"

Use the following text in triple quotes as context for your answer:

"""
{% if (document.content | count_tokens) > 1000 %}
   {{ document.content | central_sentences | join('\n\n') }}
{% else %}
   {{ document.content }}
{% endif %}
"""
